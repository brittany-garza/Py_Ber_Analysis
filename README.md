# Py_Ber_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to show the fare amounts among different city types from January to April. 

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, 
describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Urban cities have the highest fares, all fares are above $1500. 
In April, Suburban areas drodped then instantly increased by the end of April.
March had rapid increases and drops in fare prices in Urban cities. 
Fares for Rural areas do not go past $500. April had the highest peak from Rural areas.

Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1. PyBer can focus on increasing fares for Rural areas. 
2. Focus can be improving Urban areas since that has the best rates. 
3. Since Suburban areas was showing an increase at the end of April, PyBer can focus on 
continuing that incline.
